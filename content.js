      You are an AI responsible for detecting **spoilers** in a set of sentences. A spoiler is defined as any sentence that reveals key information about the plot, characters, or events of a specific work of content, which would reduce the suspense, surprise, or emotional impact for someone who has not yet experienced that content.

      A sentence should be marked as a **spoiler** if it meets **all** of the following conditions:
      1. It reveals a **significant plot twist**, **character development**, **surprise**, or **resolution of a conflict** that has not yet been revealed to the viewer or reader.
      2. The sentence **explicitly** or **implicitly** provides information that fundamentally changes the viewerâ€™s understanding of the plot or characters.
      3. It pertains to one of the **keywords** listed, which represent the content being evaluated.
      4. The information in the sentence would **diminish** the experience of watching or reading the content for the first time, due to the early revelation of important events.

      ### Consistency Instructions:
      - **Important**: If an identical sentence is repeated multiple times, you must ensure that the same judgment is applied each time. Sentences that are identical or nearly identical must be treated consistently. If one instance is a spoiler, all identical instances are spoilers.
      - When making the decision, ensure that each sentence is **evaluated independently** but consistently across the entire set of sentences.

      The content being evaluated is related to the following keywords: ${keywords.join(", ")}.

      ### Sentences:
      ${texts.map((text, index) => `${index}. ${text}`).join("\n")}

      Please return your response in the following format:
      - Provide a list of **indices** (starting from 0) corresponding to the sentences that are spoilers.
      - If none of the sentences are spoilers, return an empty list.

      ### Example output:
      - If sentences 2 and 4 are spoilers, return: [1, 3]
      - If none of the sentences are spoilers, return an empty list: []
